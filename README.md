# Residue C++ Client
Official C++ client library with feature-rich API to interact with residue seamlessly. It uses [Easylogging++](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp) to interact and take input from the user. Easylogging++ is highly efficient, well-tested library.

It is developed separately because of different license
