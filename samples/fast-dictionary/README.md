This sample is based on [Easylogging++ Qt sample](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp/tree/master/samples/Qt/fast-dictionary)

Please note, this is not very stable program as it's not written for this purpose but we will make improvements to this to demonstrate how to work with Residue client library.
